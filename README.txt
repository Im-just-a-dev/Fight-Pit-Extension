Hey! So, I'm broke as frick and can’t pay the $5 Google Dashboard fee right now, but you can still install this extension manually by following these steps:

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.

Turn on Developer mode (top right corner).

Click Load unpacked and select the folder containing this extension.

And that’s it! You’re good to go.
